bio: My research focuses on the earliest stages of the Upper Paleolithic. I am currently analyzing several Aurignacian sites in Italy to better understand the chrono-cultural development of this technocomplex and explore the role of climate change and cultural transmission in the evolution of stone tool technologies.

Welcome to my website! I am a Principal Investigator at the [**Institute for Archaeological Sciences**](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/geosciences/work-groups/prehistory-and-archaeological-sciences/ina/) at the University of Tübingen. My expertise lies in the intersection of lithic technology, experimental archaeology, and 3D visualization techniques.

Between 2020 and 2025, I led the [**DFG-funded project**](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/431809858?language=en) titled *Investigating Early Upper Paleolithic technological variability and cultural dynamics south of the Alps*, where I explored the cultural dynamics that shaped the Aurignacian in regions south of the Alps and along the Italian Peninsula. This research combined traditional archaeological methods with experimental archaeology and advanced 3D-based approaches to analyze lithic artifacts, shedding light on past human behavior and cultural transmission processes.

Beyond my core research, I am passionate about promoting Open Science practices. I developed comprehensive open-access repositories dedicated to the Italian Aurignacian. These repositories provide researchers worldwide with access to high-resolution [**3D models**](https://www.armandofalcucci.com/project/open_aurignacian/) and
[**attribute-based datasets**](https://www.armandofalcucci.com/datasets/) of stone tool assemblages from stratified sites, fostering further exploration and collaboration in the field.
