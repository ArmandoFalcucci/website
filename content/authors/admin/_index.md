bio: My research focus on the earliest stages of the Upper Paleolithic. I am currently analyzing several Aurignacian sites in Italy to better frame the chrono-cultural development of this technocomplex and investigate the role of climate change in the evolution of stone tool technologies.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Geosciences, Prehistory and Archaeological Sciences Research Unit, University of Tübingen. My main research activities combine lithic technology and 3D visualization techniques to answer questions related to past human behavior. I am currently investigating the cultural dynamics that led to the development of the Aurignacian south of the Alps and along the Italian Peninsula. I analyze lithic assemblages using a combination of traditional methods (e.g., attribute analysis and reduction sequence analysis) and 3D-based approaches (e.g., geometric morphometrics, virtual refittings, and core reduction intensity). Furthermore, I conduct systematic inter-layer refits and lithic taphonomic analyses to assess the integrity of the lithic assemblages I am working on. One of my short-term goals is to create an open-access repository of the Italian Aurignacian, where researchers across the world will be able to access to accurate 3D models and technological datasets of the stone tool assemblages recovered across several stratified sites.
