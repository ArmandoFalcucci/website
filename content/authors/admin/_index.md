bio: My research focuses on the earliest stages of the Upper Paleolithic. I am currently analyzing several Aurignacian sites in Italy to better understand the chrono-cultural development of this technocomplex and explore the role of climate change in the evolution of stone tool technologies.

Welcome to my website! I am a Principal Investigator at the [**Institute for Archaeological Sciences**](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/geosciences/work-groups-contacts/prehistory-and-archaeological-sciences/ina/) at the University of Tübingen. My expertise lies in the intersection of lithic technology and 3D visualization techniques.

Since 2020, I have been leading the [**DFG-funded project**](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/431809858?language=en) titled *Investigating Early Upper Paleolithic technological variability and cultural dynamics south of the Alps*, where I explore the cultural dynamics that shaped the Aurignacian in regions south of the Alps and along the Italian Peninsula. My research combines traditional archaeological methods with advanced 3D-based approaches to analyze lithic artifacts, shedding light on past human behavior.

Beyond my core research, I am passionate about promoting Open Science practices. I am currently working on the development of open-access repositories dedicated to the Italian Aurignacian. These repositories will provide researchers worldwide with access to 3D models and comprehensive datasets of stone tool assemblages from stratified sites, fostering further exploration and collaboration in the field.
