bio: My research focuses on the earliest stages of the Upper Paleolithic across Europe and the Levant. I am currently investigating several Aurignacian and Ahmarian sites to understand the intricate relationships between archaeological patterns, cultural transmission, demic spread, and technological convergence.
interests:
  - Paleolithic Archaeology
  - Lithic Technology
  - Experimental Archaeology
  - Cultural Transmission
  - Open Science
  - 3D Visualization

Welcome to my website! I am a **Global Marie Skłodowska‑Curie Fellow** at the [**Department of Anthropology**](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/anthropology.html) at New York University and the [**Interdisciplinary Center for Archaeology and Evolution of Human Behavior (ICArEHB)**](https://www.icarehb.com/) at the University of Algarve, leading the [**RStone**](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101152531) project: *Population interconnectivity and technological trajectories in southern Africa during MIS3 through replicable lithic analysis*. This fellowship allows me to develop standardized, quantitative methods for lithic analysis, apply 3D visualization techniques to MIS3 assemblages across southern Africa, and test hypotheses about cultural fragmentation during the MIS3.

In parallel, I am a **Research Associate** at the [**Institute for Archaeological Sciences**](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/geosciences/work-groups/prehistory-and-archaeological-sciences/ina/) at the University of Tübingen, where I teach courses on Stone Age Technology, the Prehistory of Mediterranean Europe, and 3D Applications in Lithic Analysis.

From 2020 to 2025, I led the [**DFG-funded project**](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/431809858?language=en) *Investigating Early Upper Paleolithic technological variability and cultural dynamics south of the Alps*. This research explored how cultural transmission and environmental factors shaped the lifeways of foragers along the Italian Peninsula between 42,000 and 36,000 years ago, combining traditional archaeological methods, experimental approaches, and advanced 3D analyses.

I am also committed to advancing **Open Science**. I have created open-access repositories for the Early Upper Paleolithic, providing researchers worldwide with high-resolution [**3D models**](https://www.armandofalcucci.com/project/open_aurignacian/) and [**attribute-based datasets**](https://www.armandofalcucci.com/datasets/) of stone tool assemblages—resources designed to foster global collaboration and improve reproducibility in archaeological research.

In 2025, I was elected as a regular **board member** of the [**European Society for the Study of Human Evolution (ESHE)**](https://www.eshe.eu/aboutus/). In this role, I contribute to fostering interdisciplinary collaboration in human evolution research, supporting early-career researchers, and promoting public engagement with the study of human origins.
