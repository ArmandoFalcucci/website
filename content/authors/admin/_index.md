bio: My research focuses on the earliest stages of the Upper Paleolithic across Europe and the Levant. I am currently investigating several Aurignacian and Ahmarian sites to understand the intricate relationships between archaeological patterns, cultural transmission, demic spread, and technological convergence.

Welcome to my website! I am a Principal Investigator at the [**Institute for Archaeological Sciences**](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/geosciences/work-groups/prehistory-and-archaeological-sciences/ina/) at the University of Tübingen, specializing in lithic technology, experimental archaeology, and 3D visualization techniques.

From 2020 to 2025, I led the [**DFG-funded project**](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/431809858?language=en) titled *Investigating Early Upper Paleolithic technological variability and cultural dynamics south of the Alps*. This research examined how cultural transmission and environmental factors shaped the lifeways of foragers south of the Alps and along the Italian Peninsula between 42,000 and 36,000 years ago, combining traditional archaeological methods with experimental approaches and advanced 3D analyses .

I am also committed to advancing Open Science. I have created open-access repositories for the Italian Aurignacian, offering researchers worldwide high-resolution [**3D models**](https://www.armandofalcucci.com/project/open_aurignacian/) and
[**attribute-based datasets**](https://www.armandofalcucci.com/datasets/) of stone tool assemblages from stratified sites—resources designed to foster global collaboration and support new advances in the field.
