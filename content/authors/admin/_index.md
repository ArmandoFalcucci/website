bio: My research focuses on the earliest stages of the Upper Paleolithic. I am currently analyzing several Aurignacian sites in Italy to better frame the chrono-cultural development of this technocomplex and investigate the role of climate change in the evolution of stone tool technologies.

Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [**Institute for Archaeological Sciences**](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/geosciences/work-groups-contacts/prehistory-and-archaeological-sciences/ina/) at the University of Tübingen. My expertise lies in the fusion of lithic technology and 3D visualization techniques. 
My current research focuses on unraveling the cultural dynamics that shaped the Aurignacian in the regions south of the Alps and along the Italian Peninsula. By employing a combination of traditional methods and cutting-edge 3D-based approaches, I meticulously analyze lithic artifacts to gain insights into past human behavior. In order to promote further exploration of this invaluable cultural heritage and open science practices, I am actively working on the establishment of open-access repositories dedicated to the Italian Aurignacian. These repositories will provide researchers from around the world with access to accurate 3D models and comprehensive datasets of stone tool assemblages discovered across various stratified sites.
