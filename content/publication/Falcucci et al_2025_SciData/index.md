abstract: 'Here, we introduce an open-access database of 3D models of stone tools (n = 2,016) from four Early Upper Paleolithic sequences excavated south of the Alps and along Peninsular Italy, including Grotta della Cala, Grotta di Castelcivita, Grotta di Fumane, and Riparo Bombrini. Available through four self-standing Zenodo repositories, these models enable in-depth analysis of core reduction procedures, reduction intensity, and shape variability. Unlike other repositories, this database has been actively used to address archaeological questions, providing a comprehensive demonstration of the use of 3D models in lithic analysis. The Open Aurignacian Project utilizes various scanning devices, including the Artec Spider, Artec Micro, and micro-computed tomography, with a focus on enhancing the reproducibility and accessibility of archaeological data. This paper presents the scanning methodology, dataset organization, and technical validation of the project, while also discussing the scientific potential of these data to foster cross-continental research collaboration. Our open-sharing initiative is designed to stimulate inter-regional studies of human behavioral evolution, offering new opportunities to address questions in Paleolithic studies through the FAIR principles.'
