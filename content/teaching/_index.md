I teach prehistoric archaeology, lithic technology, and 3D-based methods in the framework of the MSc program [**Archaeological Sciences and Human Evolution**](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/study/finding-a-course/degree-programs-available/detail/course/archaeological-sciences-and-human-evolution-master/) at the [**Institute for Archaeological Sciences**](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/geosciences/work-groups-contacts/prehistory-and-archaeological-sciences/ina/) (University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany). My classes are usually taking place during the Summer semester.



### Prehistory of Mediterranean Europe: Late Neanderthals and Modern Humans

This seminar covers the archaeology of Mediterranean Europe from the late Middle Paleolithic to the early phases of the Upper Paleolithic. Students are asked to read, present, and critically discuss recent research papers that deal with several aspects of the archaeological sciences (e.g., lithic technology, geoarchaeology, radiocarbon dating, zooarchaeology).

### 3D Applications in Lithic Analysis

Introduction to scanning technologies for the documentation of stone tools and other archaeological artifacts. Students will learn the different steps related to a 3D-based research study, starting from the digitization of artifacts using 3D scanners (e.g., Artec Spider and Artec Micro) and photogrammetry. 3D meshes are then used as a case-study to learn how to use open-source software such as [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/), [Cloudcompare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/), [Artifact3-D](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268401), [AGMT3-D](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207890), and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). Particular importance will be given to geometric morphometric techniques, data visualization, and open science practices.

### Stone Age Technology

This lecture is shared between different instructors and provides an in-depth overview of the research in Stone Age technology. Students will be introduced to the methods and theories behind the analysis of botanical, osseous, and lithic artifacts using a diachronic approach.
