title: 'Reevaluating the Early Upper Paleolithic Sequence at Ksâr ‘Akil, Lebanon (Layers XX-XIB)'
summary: This project aims to reexamine the Early Upper Paleolithic sequence at Ksâr ‘Akil, Lebanon, focusing on the lithic assemblages from layers XX-XIB. By analyzing technological variability, the project explores the untested connections between the Early Ahmarian and the European Protoaurignacian.

**Research Objectives**
- Examine the lithic assemblages from layers XX-XIB, excavated during the 1947–1948 Boston College excavation at Ksâr ‘Akil, currently housed at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University.
- Quantify technological variability across the stratigraphic sequence and refine our understanding of the site's chrono-cultural development through core reduction sequence analysis, attribute analysis, and 3D modeling.
- Investigate the techno-typological diversity of the Early Ahmarian and explore its potential connections to the European Protoaurignacian, a relationship that has yet to be tested.
- Develop an Open Access repository featuring 3D models and attribute data.

**Research Collaborator**
