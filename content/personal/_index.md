### Guitars

When time allows, I love to play my acoustic and electric guitars. I am particularly fond of blues, classic rock, and folk music. In the picture below, you can see (starting from left) my Fender Telecaster, Epiphone EJ-200SCE, and Fender Stratocaster.

### Vinyl Collection

Together with my wife, we enjoy listening to music a lot. We have a steadily growing [**vinyl collection**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLQJCsHEXMNvG0gtcwnpjwR3V6XjBxpAaYvffe6sHI4/edit?usp=sharing), mostly thanks to my father-in-law. Contrarily to music streaming services, I do believe that vinyls allow to truly enjoy an album as a stand-alone work. Nothing compares to the dusty, crackling sound of a 12-inch LP record!
